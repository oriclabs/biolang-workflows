## Emerging Specializations

The bioinformatics job market is evolving rapidly. Several specializations have emerged in recent years:

**Single-cell bioinformatics.** Single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics generate fundamentally different data from bulk methods. Specialists in single-cell analysis are in high demand at research institutes and biotechs working on cell atlases, immunology, and developmental biology.

**Clinical genomics and precision medicine.** As genomic testing becomes standard clinical care, hospitals need bioinformaticians who can build and validate clinical-grade pipelines, interpret variants according to ACMG guidelines, and work within regulatory frameworks (CAP, CLIA).

**Multi-omics integration.** Combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics data requires specialized statistical and computational skills. This is particularly relevant in cancer research and drug discovery.

**AI/ML for biology.** Machine learning applications in protein structure prediction (AlphaFold), drug discovery, and variant interpretation are growing rapidly. Bioinformaticians with ML skills command premium salaries.

**Cloud genomics engineering.** Large-scale genomic data is increasingly processed on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). Specialists who can architect cost-effective, scalable genomic workflows are valuable in both industry and large research consortia.

## Getting Started

You do not need a degree to start working in bioinformatics. Many successful bioinformaticians are self-taught biologists who learned to code, or software engineers who learned biology. What matters is demonstrating competence through:

1. **A portfolio.** Put your analysis scripts on GitHub. Write up your capstone projects (Days 28-30) as if they were research reports.

2. **Contributions.** Contribute to open-source bioinformatics tools. Answer questions on Biostars. Help maintain documentation.

3. **Publications.** Even as a trainee, you can co-author papers by contributing analyses. Preprints on bioRxiv count.

4. **Networking.** Attend conferences (ISMB, ASHG, RECOMB). Join local bioinformatics meetups. Follow bioinformaticians on social media.

The 30 days of this book give you the technical foundation. The career you build on top of it depends on where you apply those skills and who you collaborate with. The field is growing faster than it can train people — there is room for you.
