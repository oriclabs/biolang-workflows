# Downloads

None of the code in this book runs in the browser: every example imports the
`singlecell` package and most read or write files, and package imports and file
I/O are CLI-only. So the pages show no Run button — copy the code, or take one
of these.

## The starter kit

**[singlecell-starter.zip](downloads/singlecell-starter.zip)** — the package, the
data-download script, every chapter script and the notebook.

```sh
unzip singlecell-starter.zip && cd singlecell-starter
bl install ./singlecell
python get-data.py
bl run ch01.bl
```

Full setup, including installing BioLang itself, is in
[Getting the Data](setup.md).

## The data script

**[get-data.py](downloads/get-data.py)** — fetches the two 10x matrices from the
HBC course's own host. 3.2 GB down, ~90 MB kept; the archive is deleted unless
you pass `--keep`. Also included in the kit.

## Chapter scripts

One per chapter, each self-contained.

| Chapter | Script | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| The Biology and the Matrix | [ch01.bl](downloads/ch01.bl) | 1 |
| Quality Control | [ch02.bl](downloads/ch02.bl) | 3 |
| Normalization and PCA | [ch03.bl](downloads/ch03.bl) | 4 |
| Integration | [ch04.bl](downloads/ch04.bl) | 2 |
| Clustering | [ch05.bl](downloads/ch05.bl) | 4 |
| Markers and Annotation | [ch06.bl](downloads/ch06.bl) | 4 |
| The Whole Workflow | [ch07.bl](downloads/ch07.bl) | 4 |

> | `ch02` | ~1 min |
> | `ch03` | ~2 min |
> | `ch04` | 3 min 35 s |
> | `ch05` | 3 min 50 s |
> | `ch06` | **over 9 min** |
> | `ch07` | **over 9 min** |

> Two things drive this. Each block on a page is written to stand alone, so a
> reader can copy any one without having run the others — which means a
> concatenated chapter rebuilds the pipeline from the raw matrix once per block.
> And two operations are inherently expensive on 15,000 cells: `plot_markers`
> runs a test per gene per cluster and takes **5 minutes** by itself, and
> `cluster_diagnostics` computes a silhouette and takes **3**.
>
> `ch06` and `ch07` were confirmed to run only in pieces, not as single scripts
> inside a ten-minute budget. Nothing in them is broken — every block produced
> the figure on its page — but if you want to follow along interactively, lift a
> single block rather than running a whole chapter.

## The course-aligned pipeline

**[aligned.bl](downloads/aligned.bl)** — the course's settings rather than this
book's: their four-criterion QC filter, SCTransform, 40 PCs, resolution 0.8. It
prints both cluster counts side by side so you can see what the parameters cost:

```text
cells: 14847
                                     GPU auto   --no-gpu
SCTransform / 40 PCs / res 0.8          15         16
log1p / 30 PCs / res 0.5                 8          8
```

Measured after the SNN-default change on 9 August 2026: 34.9 seconds with GPU
auto-detection enabled (NVIDIA RTX 3080), and 33.0 seconds with `--no-gpu`.

**[exact.bl](downloads/exact.bl)** — the full integrated configuration: both
samples, their filter, SCTransform, Harmony, 40 PCs, resolution 0.8:

```text
mode          cells   clusters   wall time
GPU auto      29629      18        71.9 s
--no-gpu      29629      16        72.5 s
Historical HBC HTML       17
```

Both modes were measured on the same release build. Large-data neighbour
ranking uses different numerical/search backends on GPU and CPU, so cells near
a graph boundary can move and the Leiden count is not guaranteed to match.
An independent current HBC CCA run with Seurat 5.5.1 gives 19 clusters; the
cell-level comparison is recorded in [What Differs from the Course](differences.md).
Harmony was the largest timed stage, not PCA or neighbour search; the measured
breakdown is recorded in [What Differs from the
Course](differences.md#runtime-regression-recheck).

[What Differs from the Course](differences.md) has the full account: what was
rewritten to match Seurat's published methods, why the count moved *away* from
17 as those fixes landed, and why one cluster count was a poor target to aim at
in the first place.

## The notebook

**[hbc-scrnaseq.bln](downloads/hbc-scrnaseq.bln)** — prose and code together,
runnable end to end:

```sh
bl notebook hbc-scrnaseq.bln
```

Several chapters write `.svg` figures into the current directory. The notebook
carries the same content as the book, minus the figures, whose paths would not
resolve beside a downloaded file.

## What you cannot download here

The dataset itself. It belongs to the study authors and is hosted by the HBC
training team; `get-data.py` fetches it from them rather than redistributing a
copy. See [Attribution and Licence](attribution.md).
